Contains Data Science project - Movie Rating Prediction 

Data Collection: Gather a dataset containing information about movies and user ratings. This dataset typically includes movie metadata (e.g., title, genre, release year) and user-specific information (e.g., user ID, rating, timestamp).

Data Preprocessing: Clean the data by handling missing values, removing duplicates, and ensuring data consistency. Additionally, you may need to encode categorical features like genres or convert timestamps into meaningful representations.

Feature Engineering: Create relevant features that capture information about movies and users. For example, you might calculate user-specific statistics like average rating, or generate movie embeddings using techniques like matrix factorization or deep learning.

Data Splitting: Divide the dataset into training and test sets. The training set is used to build the prediction model, while the test set evaluates its performance. You can also consider using techniques like k-fold cross-validation.

Model Selection: Choose an appropriate machine learning model or recommendation algorithm for the task. Common choices include collaborative filtering (user-based, item-based), matrix factorization, and deep learning models like neural collaborative filtering.

Model Training: Train the selected model on the training data. This involves learning the underlying patterns and relationships between movies and user ratings.

Model Evaluation: Assess the model's performance on the test set using evaluation metrics like Mean Squared Error (MSE), Root Mean Squared Error (RMSE), Mean Absolute Error (MAE), or others suitable for regression tasks.

Prediction: Once the model is trained and evaluated, it can be used to predict user ratings for movies that haven't been rated yet. These predictions can then be used to make movie recommendations to users.

Movie rating prediction is a crucial component of recommendation systems used by platforms like Netflix, Amazon Prime Video, and IMDb to enhance user experience and engagement by suggesting movies that are likely to be of interest to individual users.
